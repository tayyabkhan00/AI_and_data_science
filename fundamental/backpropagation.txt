🧠 Backpropagation

Backpropagation is how a neural network learns.
Simple idea:
Make a prediction
Compare with the true answer
Calculate how wrong it is (loss)
Move weights in the direction that makes the loss smaller
Repeat again and again
This is exactly how humans learn from mistakes.

⭐ Step-by-Step Intuition 
1️⃣ Network makes a prediction
Example:
Actual label = 1
Model predicts = 0.2
→ Bad prediction.

2️⃣ Compute the loss
Example (Binary Cross Entropy):
Loss = high → model is wrong.

3️⃣ The model asks:
“Which weight caused the mistake?”
Different weights affect predictions differently.

4️⃣ Compute gradients
A gradient tells:
direction to move
how much to move
Think of it like:
Hot → go left
Cold → go right
Gradients show the steepest direction to reduce loss.

5️⃣ Update the weights
Using Gradient Descent:
new_weight = old_weight - learning_rate * gradient
Small learning rate → slow learning
Huge learning rate → unstable model

⭐ Putting It All Together
Forward Pass:
input → weight → activation → output
Backward Pass (Backprop):
output → loss → compute gradients → update weights
Neural networks train by doing:
Forward → Backward → Forward → Backward → ... (many epochs)

⭐ Example (Super Simple)
Consider 1 neuron:
output = w*x + b
Prediction vs actual → find loss.
Then backprop adjusts:
weight (w)
bias (b)
So next time prediction becomes a little better.
After thousands of updates → model becomes smart.
