⭐ Step 1 — The RNN You Created
rnn = nn.RNN(input_size=5, hidden_size=10, num_layers=1, batch_first=True)

Meaning (Kid version):
input_size = 5
Each word is represented as 5 numbers.
Think of it like:
A word is a small vector: [2.1, -0.5, 0.3, 1.2, -0.7]
hidden_size = 10
The RNN's "memory" is made of 10 numbers.
This is like the brain size of the RNN.
num_layers = 1
How many RNN brains stacked together? → Just 1.
batch_first=True
Means the input will be shaped as:
(batch, sequence_length, features)
Or simply:
"First tell me how many sentences (batch), then how many words, then each word size."

⭐ Step 2 — Creating Input Data
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 5)
Meaning:
x is your sentence.
Break it:
1 → batch size = 1 sentence
3 → the sentence has 3 words
5 → each word has 5 features (like 5 numbers representing a word)
So visually:
Sentence:
[
   [word1: [5 numbers],
    word2: [5 numbers],
    word3: [5 numbers]]
]
Example inside the RNN’s head:
Word 1 → [0.2, -1.5, 0.3, 1.1, -0.6]
Word 2 → [-0.9, 0.4, 0.8, -1.1, 0.0]
Word 3 → [1.2, -0.2, 0.3, 0.7, -0.9]

⭐ Step 3 — Feeding the Sentence to RNN
output, hidden = rnn(x)
NOW the magic happens.
Imagine the RNN as a small kid reading 3 words:
➤ At Word 1
RNN reads word1 (5 numbers)
Turns it into memory of size 10
Saves this memory → hidden1
➤ At Word 2
RNN reads word2
Also looks at memory from word1
Updates memory → hidden2
➤ At Word 3
RNN reads word3
Looks at memory from word2
Updates memory → hidden3
This final memory is your hidden state.

⭐ Step 4 — Understanding the Output
✔ What is output?
This is the RNN's brain output at every word.
Shape:
(1 sentence, 3 words, 10 memory values)
So:
output[0,0] → output after word 1
output[0,1] → output after word 2
output[0,2] → output after word 3

✔ What is hidden?
The final memory after reading the LAST word.
Shape:
(1 layer, 1 sentence, 10 memory values)
Meaning:
This is what the RNN "remembers" from the whole sentence.
This hidden state can be used for:
Sentiment analysis
Next word prediction
Sequence classification

🧒 Kid-Friendly Story Version
Imagine the RNN is a kid reading a 3-word sentence:
Word 1: "I"
Word 2: "love"
Word 3: "pizza"
Each word is 5 numbers.
At each word:
The kid reads the word (5 numbers).
The kid thinks and stores memory (10 numbers).
Moves to next word with that memory.
At the end:
output = what the kid thought after EACH word
hidden = what the kid remembers at the END

📝 Simple Visualization
input = [word1, word2, word3]

          ↓
output = [o1, o2, o3]
hidden = final_memory
